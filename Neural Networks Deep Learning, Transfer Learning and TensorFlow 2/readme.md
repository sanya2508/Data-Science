# Neural Networks Deep Learning, Transfer Learning and TensorFlow 2


### Kind of deep learning problems: 
 * Classification
 * Sequence to sequence
 * Object Detection


## Transfer Learning: 
 * Take what you know in one domain, and apply it to another.
 
### Tensorflow Workflow:
  1. Get data ready (Turn into tensors)
  2. Pick a model (to suit your orblem)    `gonna use tensorflow hub for this`
  3. Fill the model to the data and make a prediction
  4. Evaluate the model
  5. Improve through experimentation
  6. Save and reload your trained model.
