# Scikit-Learn (sklearn):

Scikit-learn is a library in Python that provides many unsupervised and supervised learning algorithms. Itâ€™s built upon some of the technology like NumPy, pandas, and Matplotlib!
<hr/>
The functionality that scikit-learn provides include:

* Regression, including Linear and Logistic Regression
* Classification, including K-Nearest Neighbors
* Clustering, including K-Means and K-Means++
* Model selection
* Preprocessing, including Min-Max Normalization
<hr/>

## Why Scikit-Learn?
* Has many in-built machine learning models.
* Methods to evaluate machine learning models.
* Very well-designed API.
