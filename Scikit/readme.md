# Scikit-Learn (sklearn):

Scikit-learn is a library in Python that provides many unsupervised and supervised learning algorithms. Itâ€™s built upon some of the technology like NumPy, pandas, and Matplotlib!
<hr/>
The functionality that scikit-learn provides include:

* Regression, including Linear and Logistic Regression
* Classification, including K-Nearest Neighbors
* Clustering, including K-Means and K-Means++
* Model selection
* Preprocessing, including Min-Max Normalization
<hr/>

## Why Scikit-Learn?
* Has many in-built machine learning models.
* Methods to evaluate machine learning models.
* Very well-designed API.
<hr/>

## Scikit-Learn workflow:

1. Getting the data ready.
2. Choose the right estimator/algorithm for our problem.
3. Fit the model/algorithm and use it to make predictions on our data.
4. Evaluating a model.
5. Improve a model.
6. Save and load a trained model.
