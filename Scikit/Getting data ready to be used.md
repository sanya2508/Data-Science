# Getting our data ready to be used with machine learning

## Three main things we have to do:

1. Split the data into features and labels (usually `X` & `y`)

2. Filling (also called imputing) or disregarding missing values.

3. Converting non-numerical values to numerical values (also called feature encoding).
